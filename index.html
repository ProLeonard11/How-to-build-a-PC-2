    <h1>How to build a PC</h1>
    <p>
      In this short manual, I will explain how I built my first PC and hopefully
      it will be a helpful guide.
    </p>
    <h2>Budget</h2>
    <p>
      The first thing to do when building a PC is set out a budget that you will
      stick to. You can give yourself a bit of leeway and add an extra £50 to
      £100 onto the budget, but just give yourself a rough estimate. A good
      starting PC price is about £700-1000. This will allow you to get some
      mid-tier quality parts without being overly expensive and still being
      reasonable.
    </p>
    <h2>Purpose of the PC and the Resolution</h2>
    <p>
      The next thing you want to consider is what kind of games or tasks you
      will be doing with the PC as well as what resolution you are going to be
      gaming in. There isn't really any point in buying a high-end graphics card
      and CPU if you are only going to be playing in 1080p. Similarly, if you
      want to also do other tasks that will require a higher-end PC such as 3D
      modeling or animation, then it would be useful to get parts that will
      accommodate and benefit that. Finally, you should also consider what types
      of games you are going to play. If you are only going to be playing
      graphically heavy games such as Fortnite or Warzone, then you don't need
      to spend as much on the CPU. Whereas if you plan on doing CPU-intensive
      games and tasks, you might want to opt for a less powerful graphics card
      in order to save money.
    </p>
    <h2>Parts list</h2>
    <p>
      Here is everything you will need in order to create a working computer.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>CPU</li>
      <li>GPU</li>
      <li>Motherboard</li>
      <li>RAM</li>
      <li>PC Case</li>
      <li>Storage</li>
      <li>Power Supply</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Optional Parts that will apply to higher-end PCs</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        CPU cooler (Most CPUs come with a stock cooler which will likely be fine
        for most people as you likely aren't going to be overclocking your CPU).
      </li>
      <li>
        Thermal Paste (Most CPU coolers come with thermal paste inside the box,
        and some come with thermal paste pre-applied, such as stock coolers.
        Applying your own thermal paste can be beneficial as you will be able to
        cover the CPU with better quality thermal paste than the stock ones
        used.)
      </li>
      <li>Extra case fans</li>
      <li>
        Operating System Key (you can use a PC without, it will just have a
        watermark which is very insignificant)
      </li>
      <li>PC case accessories such as custom cables and custom lighting</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      That is everything you need in order to make a PC, now we'll go over what
      components you should get in order to get the best experience possible for
      your budget.
    </p>

    <h2>CPU</h2>
    <p>
      Your CPU should be the very first thing you should consider when making a
      PC. You will either choose between two CPU companies: Intel and AMD.
    </p>
    <p>
      There will be benefits to both of the brands but depending on your budget
      and the type of activities you will be doing on your PC, one will be the
      right one for you.
    </p>
    <h3>
      In this table, we will outline the benefits and drawbacks to each of the
      brands.
    </h3>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>User Requirement</th>
        <th>AMD</th>
        <th>Intel</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Price</td>
        <td>Cheaper</td>
        <td>More Expensive</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Power Consumption</td>
        <td>Higher Power Consumption</td>
        <td>Lower Power Consumption</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Cooling Factor</td>
        <td>Runs Hotter (on most models)</td>
        <td>Runs cooler (on most models)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Gaming Performance</td>
        <td>Faster</td>
        <td>Slower</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Productivity</td>
        <td>AMD has worse performance</td>
        <td>Intel is better at productivity and multi-tasking</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Reliability</td>
        <td>Less Reliable</td>
        <td>More Reliable</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      So, to summarize, Intel is generally better at multi-tasking and
      productivity but, AMD has more raw performance and will be better for
      gaming, as well as having better price to performance than Intel.
    </p>
    <h2>The best CPU for Gaming</h2>
    <p>These are the best CPUs to buy for each tier.</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Tier</th>
        <th>AMD</th>
        <th>Intel</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>High</td>
        <td>Ryzen 7 7800X3D</td>
        <td>Intel I9-13900K</td>

    <h2>GPU</h2>
    <p>
      Much like CPUs there are two main brands that produce GPU those being
      Nvidia and AMD.
    </p>
    <p>
      The GPU is likely going to be the most expensive part in your PC, this
      means you may want to prioritize this over other components. As stated
      before if you are going to be playing more graphic intensive games then
      spending more on your GPU will get you much better performance.
    </p>
    <h2>The best GPUs for Gaming</h2>
    <p>
      This table will give a brief outline of the best GPUs for each tier and
      price point, unlike CPUs there are a lot more options which will all be
      great options, you mainly want to find a graphics card that is correct for
      the resolution you want to play and a GPU inside of your budget.
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Brand</th>
        <th>1080p</th>
        <th>1440p</th>
        <th>4k</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>AMD</td>
        <td>AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT</td>
        <td>AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT</td>
        <td>AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Nvidia</td>
        <td>GeForce RTX 3050</td>
        <td>GeForce RTX 4070 Ti</td>
        <td>GeForce RTX 4090</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      So, to summarize AMD generally has cheaper GPUs and will offer better
      price to performance. But at the higher end of the scale, Nvidia is much
      better at 4k than AMD.

    <h2>Motherboards</h2>
    <p>
      There are 3 major form factors of Motherboard: the standard ATX, the
      slightly smaller MicroATX and the even smaller Mini-ITX. The form factor
      you choose will greatly affect the slots and features on the board.
      Similarly, the size of the motherboard will determine the size of case you
      buy, for example, an ATX motherboard won't fit in a Mini-ITX case.
    </p>
    <p>
      It doesn't really matter the brand of motherboard you get. The main thing
      to consider is the form factor and also the chipset that is compatible
      with the motherboard. For example, there are AM5 and AM4 motherboards that
      will only work with their corresponding chips. So, you must ensure you get
      the correct motherboard for your brand and model of CPU, and if you want
      to have a WIFI compatible motherboard.
    </p>
    <h3>Here are some recommended motherboards</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>

    <h2>RAM</h2>
    <p>
      When buying RAM you need to consider three things: <b>Size of RAM</b>,
      <b>Speed of RAM</b>, <b>DDR4 Vs DDR5</b>.
    </p>
    <h3>Size of RAM</h3>
    <p>
      The size of RAM usually ranges from 2GB to 64GB and even extending up to
      128GB sometimes. The size of RAM will entirely depend on how much you are
      willing to spend on your PC, obviously more RAM will increase gaming and
      work performance but will be much more expensive
    </p>
    <p>
      I would recommend that most people need at least 16GB of RAM if they want
      to play modern games. 32GB of RAM is probably a good amount for any
      Mid-range setup.
    </p>
    <h3>Speed of RAM</h3>
    <p>
      You can see the speed of your RAM by looking at the CAS latency, this
      number will usually be listed in the Specs of the product. The lower the
      number the faster the RAM
    </p>
    <h3>DDR4 Vs DDR5</h3>
    <p>
      There are two main types of RAM that are available, DDR4 and DDR5. DDR4 is
      the older and slower RAM but will be a lot cheaper than DDR5 this means
      that it will be fine for budget setups but probably wont be fast enough
      for Mid to higher tier builds. DDR5 will be faster at the downside of
      costing more because it is a lot more in demand.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>PC Case</h2>
    <p>
      The PC case you buy will mainly have to support the size of your
      motherboard, so there is no point in buying a Mini-ITX case for an ATX
      motherboard because it wont fit. The PC case you choose will depend on 2
      things: Price and Aesthetics. The type of case you choose won't impact
      performance but more expensive cases usually look better.
    </p>
    <p>
      A good PC case for beginners is the
      <a
        href="https://www.corsair.com/uk/en/p/pc-cases/cc-9011200-ww/4000d-airflow-tempered-glass-mid-tower-atx-case-black-cc-9011200-ww"
        target="_blank"
        >Corsair 4000D</a
      >
    </p>

    <h2>Storage</h2>
    <p>
      The capacity of storage and the type of storage are the two things you
      need to consider before purchasing. There is HDD, SSD, and NVMe drives.
      HDDs are quite old and out of date they are too slow for modern computers.
      SSD drives are good for modern low to mid range computers. The best type
      of storage is NVMe, as it is the fastest and also the smallest so its much
      easier to manage.
    </p>

    <h2>Power Supply</h2>
    <p>
      When making a PC you need to ensure that you get a power supply powerful
      enough for your setup, ensuring your power supply is adequate means you
      will get a better, smoother gaming performance. The best way to check how
      much power your PC needs is to look it up for your individual graphics
      card, this is because the GPU usually uses the most power. For example,
      the RTX 4070 has a recommended minimum PSU of 650W. Similarly, you want to
      find a PSU that has a good efficiency rating, this usually ranges from
      Bronze to Platinum, the higher the efficiency rating the better your PC
      will run.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best way to find a good PSU is by looking at
      <a href="https://cultists.network/140/psu-tier-list/" target="_blank"
        >PSU tier lists</a
      >, they are a very easy and efficient way to find a suitable PSU for your
      system.
